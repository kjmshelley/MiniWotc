# MiniWotc
MiniWotc is a simple program that allows maintenace of WOTC data. 
The system is not complete. Rather is a simple example of how to
implement a WOTC system. There are two systems. 

The first one is eWotc. This is a web base app using Webforms. 

The second one is Wotc Extracter. This is a simple extract program.
You can extract any data from any datasource, transform it and export
it to a file. The system is design to allow the developer custom the
export to his/her liking. It runs from a bat file. So once the extract
is coded, you can put the run command with the correct parameters and
set the bat to run a on a schedule task.
